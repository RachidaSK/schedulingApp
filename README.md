SchedulingApp allows users to booked appointements. When one time slot is clicked, pop up a modal which asks for name and phone number.When the name and phone number is submitted, the time slot selected changes to red, indicating the time slot is no longer available. If the red time slot is clicked on again, the modal will pop up with the name and phone number for that appointment prepopulated.
